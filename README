libssp_nonshared
----------------

libssp_nonshared is minimalistic static library with one function:
__stack_chk_fail_local(void) { __stack_chk_fail(); }

This will allow using SSP on i686 architecture while using musl libc.

Note: gcc has to be pached in order this to work!

There is a gcc ebuild in fenno-musl overlay which will apply the
gcc patch. gcc modification was originally spotted here:
* https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2012-01/msg00012.html

Alpine Linux version of this code is integrated to musl Pakcage and
was seen here
